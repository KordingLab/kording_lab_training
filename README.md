Kording Lab Training Session
======================

Repository for training session by Titipat Achakulvisut at Kording's Lab.

## Session 1

Presentation covers how to get up running [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) on Quest (Northwestern Computing Clusters). Notebook goes through Map Reduce algorithm where we provide an example on a simple text file. We then implement stochatic gradient descent to train Logistic Regression in order to classify MNIST dataset. Here is a [link](http://klab.smpp.northwestern.edu/wiki/images/9/9b/Big_data_klab.pdf) to a presentation file.


## Session 2

In this presentation, We will go through simple neural network architecture and math behind it. We will then code the back propagation algorithm and test it on few examples.
