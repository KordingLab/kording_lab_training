Kording Lab Training Session
======================

Repository for training session by Titipat Achakulvisut at Kording's Lab.

## Session 1

Presentation covers how to get up running [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) on Quest (Northwestern Computing Clusters). Notebook goes through Map Reduce algorithm where we provide an example on a simple text file. We then implement stochatic gradient descent to train Logistic Regression in order to classify MNIST dataset. Here is a [link](http://klab.smpp.northwestern.edu/wiki/images/9/9b/Big_data_klab.pdf) to a presentation file.


## Session 2

This tutorial is one of the Deep learning tutorial by Kording lab.
In this presentation, we will go through simple neural network architecture and math behind it including forward propagation and back propagation.
We will then code the forward propagation and back propagation algorithm and test it on MNIST examples. If we have time, we will go through existing
python packages that implement Neural Network (e.g. [`Lasagne`](https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne), [`scikit-neuralnetwork`](https://github.com/aigamedev/scikit-neuralnetwork), [`pybrain`](http://pybrain.org/), [`nolearn`](https://github.com/dnouri/nolearn).
